# Audio-Processing-in-Hearing-Aid-using-MATLAB
Audio Processing in Hearing Aid This project enhances audio clarity for hearing-impaired users using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques. It includes noise reduction and signal amplification, implemented in Embedded C on a microcontroller. MATLAB was used for DSP algorithm simulation and real-time testing for improved speech clarity.
